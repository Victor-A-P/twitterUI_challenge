# twitterUI_challenge

This repository documents a personal challenge I took on while learning SwiftUI: replicating the user interface of X (formerly Twitter) using only overlays and backgrounds. The goal was to deepen my understanding of SwiftUI’s layout system and modifiers by recreating a complex, real-world UI without custom views or external libraries.

## Features

- Replicates the core layout of the Twitter/X app using SwiftUI.
- Uses only overlays and backgrounds for UI composition—no custom views.
- Modular and readable Swift code.
- Includes a video demonstration of the UI in action.

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Victor-A-P/twitterUI_challenge.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```
   open twitterChallenge.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Select a simulator (e.g., iPhone 16 Pro) and build/run the project.

No external dependencies are required; the project uses only SwiftUI.

## Usage

- Open the app in the iOS Simulator or on a real device.
- Explore the interface to see how overlays and backgrounds are used to build each component.
- For a quick look, watch the demo video included in the repository.
